Contributing Guidelines
=======================

This project is an open source version of code that I use in my work, released (under this [license](LICENSE.md)) for the benefit of others. It is developed and maintained in my own time, and hence I cannot guarantee responses. While contributions are welcome, please keep the following points in mind:

- Please be civil to myself and other contributors.
- Do raise issues for bugs and other implementation problems/improvements.
- If you have studied the repo and have a question, raise an issue (it could possibly be a bug).
- Bug fixes and small improvements are very welcome.
- Raise an issue before developing a large contribution to a) discuss b) see if I would be willing to merge it (you're obviously free to keep your own fork) c) prevent overlap with others.
- All code contributions should adhere to the existing style (e.g., 2-space indent, no max line length, etc.).
